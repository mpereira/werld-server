TODO
* restart stuff when shit happens.

* use OTP behaviors (need to level up on erlang first).

* disconnect should lookup client list by socket, remove the matching client
  record and multicast this event. this is a better approach than the client
  having to send an unregister event.

* when receiving a player event, multicast only that player instead of the
  entire player list.

* generate data shared between projects (e.g. response types) programatically
  from metadata.

* discover root cause of smushed TCP packets when the network latency is higher
  than loopback's.

DONE
* add client on connect rather than only when an event occurs.
